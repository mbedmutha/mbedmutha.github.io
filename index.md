I am Manas Bedmutha, a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego working at the [Human-centered eXtended Intelligence (HXI)](https://hxi.ucsd.edu/) lab led by [Nadir Weibel](https://hxi.ucsd.edu/author/nadir-weibel/).

My research lies at the intersection of <a style="color:#4b2e83"><b>human computer interaction</b></a> and <a style="color:#4b2e83"><b>health</b></a>. In my research, I use signal processing and machine learning on ubiquitous devices to interpret and interact with user behaviors. My current focus lies on human-AI interaction with the goal of making AI accessible and trustworthy through novel sensing and interaction ideas.

I've been a part of the [UnBIASED](https://www.unbiased.health) project, aimed at discovering implicit bias in social behaviors between doctor patient interactions. Through this, I've built social signal processing (SSP) [systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3641998) to track and visualize non-verbal cues in these conversations, among other ongoing work. 

Parallelly, I also work on health sensing, in which I aim to build responsible AI solutions that can be run on <a style="color:#4b2e83"><b>ubiquitous</b></a> devices. Over a summer at Dexcom, I built algorithms to track novel insights from glucose data. In addition, I designed [privacy-preserving](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3594739.3610733) algorithms for tracking respiratory health and am currently expanding on making cardiac screening more accessible.   

<a style="color:#4b2e83"><b>I am on the lookout for research internships spanning social signal processing (affective computing) and mobile sensing.</b></a>

The seeds of interdisciplinary research and user focused design were founded in me during my undergraduate studies at [IIT Gandhinagar](http://iitgn.ac.in/). This was furthered as I [built a startup](https://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/campusupbeat-being-their-own-boss/67780693.html), led early stage Data Science at [Hotel Cloud](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hotel-cloud/) and designed hardware products for [Enphase Energy](https://enphase.com).

I maintain a list of my publications under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab.
